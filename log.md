# 100 Days Of Code - Log

##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.

Day 1: October 23, 2022

Today's Progress: Implemented merge sort algorithm using Linked List data structure

Thoughts: I have been working through a data structure and algorithms course for a few days. I have created the linked list data structure from scratch previously and implemented merge sort using the array (list in python) data structure. Linked list implementation follows the same approach but is definitely tough to get your head around at first time.

Day 2: October 24, 2022

Today's Progress: Implemented Selection sort algorithm and quick sort algorithm

Thoughts: With so many sorting algorithms it is difficult to remember what each one of them does, but I feel like after seeing them multiple times and tinkering with them I am starting to internalize them.
